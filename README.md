 <h2>Why is it saying "You don't have enough permissions or the dj role to use this command." while using some commands?</h2>
    <p>
    It is mainly because the dj system is enabled as default and this will show up if you don't have enough permission (default: Deafen Members) or dj role (if there is a dj setup).<br><br>

    You cannot disable this without doing the dj setup! If you already have a dj setup or dj role then you just have to <b>dj toggle</b> command, this will toggle enable/disable the dj system. <a href = "#how-can-i-setup-a-dj-rolesystem">Click here to see how to setup dj role/setup!</a>
